# like-express

How do I use Sails programmatically, or with my own custom file structure?

This code is the verbatim output of the [sails-generate-new-but-like-express]() generator.  It is an example is designed to look exactly like a boilerplate Express app to demonstrate that you can set up your Sails project however you like, and load your business logic in many different ways.

> **IMPORTANT**
> You cannot run this project using `sails lift`.  You need to do run `npm start` (which calls `node app.js`).  The app.js file loads routes.
